            <h3>E-commerce Website</h3>

                 It typically includes a product catalog, where items are categorized for easy browsing, along with detailed product pages containing descriptions, images, and pricing information. 
                 The shopping cart allows customers to add products for purchase, while the checkout process involves order summaries, payment gateways, and shipping details.

            <h3>Portfolio Site</h3>
            <p>A portfolio website is an online platform where individuals, especially creative professionals like designers, photographers, developers, and artists, can showcase their work, skills, and experiences. 
                A responsive HTML/CSS design for such a site ensures that it adapts seamlessly to various devices, from desktops to mobile phones. The website typically includes a homepage with an introduction, a portfolio section featuring visual examples of work, an about page detailing the individualâ€™s background, and a contact page with a form or contact details for inquiries.
                 Responsive design is achieved using CSS media queries, which allow the layout to change dynamically depending on the screen size, ensuring a user-friendly experience across different devices. This approach makes the site accessible and visually appealing on all screen sizes, with elements like navigation menus adjusting to smaller screens and content being displayed in flexible grids.
                  By using clean, modern designs, large images, and simple typography, a portfolio site offers an effective and professional way to present one's work to potential clients or collaborators.</p>

                The app should allow users to easily track various activities, such as running or strength training, providing real-time data like distance, time, and heart rate.
                 Goal-setting features are essential, allowing users to set targets and track progress using visual elements like progress bars and graphs.
                  Additionally, the app should provide detailed stats and history of workouts, as well as health data such as heart rate and sleep tracking.</p>
