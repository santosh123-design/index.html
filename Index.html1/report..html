        <h2>Report site:Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
            This website is designed as a personal portfolio for web developer Santosh Roka.
             The primary goal of this project is to display the work, expertise, and background of the developer in a clean, professional manner. 
             The website has been developed using HTML and CSS, with the layout being fully responsive on different screen sizes, from mobile to tablet to desktop. 
             There are five pages to the project: Home, Projects, Contact, Demo, and Site Report, each serving its function in the website's overall composition.</p>
             <h2>Home page</h2>
             <p>The Home page greets the visitor to the portfolio website.
                There is a hero section with a welcome message from the developer, Santosh Roka, emphasizing 
                his skills as a web developer and digital artist. The page also includes a brief bio that describes the developer's background in 
                front-end development and user interface design. The design is minimalist but engaging, with a call-to-action button that encourages 
                users to go to the Projects page to see Santosh's work. The design is fully responsive, so it will render well on both desktop and mobile.</p>

                <h3>Project Page</h3>
                <p>The Projects page displays a selection of Santosh's work. It is laid out on a grid system with each project being 
                    one item with a project title and brief description. The projects displayed are an E-commerce Website, Portfolio Site,
                     Mobile App UI, and a Blog Platform. The content is arranged in a way that emphasizes both the technical and creative nature of the work. 
                     Every project seeks to demonstrate Santosh's abilities to develop functional, responsive, and user-friendly websites and applications.
                      The page is also mobile-responsive, so it is easy for users to navigate the projects on smaller screens.</p>

                      <h2>Contact Page</h2>
                      <p>The Contact page provides an easy way for prospective clients, collaborators, or simply visitors to get in touch with Santosh.
                        It presents contact information such as his location, phone number, and email address. Additionally, there is a simple contact
                         form where users can input their full name, email, and message to directly contact. This page is designed to be user-friendly with
                          simple form fields to understand and a minimal design. The design is responsive, and hence the contact form is easily accessible on both
                           desktop and mobile devices.</p>

                           <h2>Demo Page</h2>
                           <p>The Demo page provides a video demo of Santosh's work or projects. 
                            It could be a video that explains his development process, highlights the key features of his projects,
                             or gives a live preview of a website or app he has developed. The page is designed with a minimalist layout, 
                             and the video player is responsive, i.e., it adjusts to different screen sizes. This page is an interactive forum 
                             for visitors to become more acquainted with Santosh's competencies and how his projects work.</p>

                             <h2>Site report page</h2>
                             <p>The Site Report page provides an overview of the website development and problems faced by the developer during the project.
                                It provides a clear explanation of the design decisions, tools and technologies used, and lessons learned during the course of developing the site. 
                                This page is used to provide an inside look at the behind-the-scenes process and demonstrates the developer's problem-solving abilities and attention to detail.
                                 The report is authored in a readable format with sections and paragraphs that address the technical aspects of developing the website, including how responsive design 
                                 was used and the benefits of using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries for a smooth user experience.</p>
