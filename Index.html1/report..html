            Developing this portfolio website has been both challenging and
            rewarding as my first major web development project. When I began
            learning HTML and CSS at the start of term, I struggled with basic
            concepts like positioning elements and understanding the box model.
            My first attempts at creating layouts using floats resulted in
            chaotic page structures that broke on different screen sizes.
            Through persistent practice and online tutorials, I gradually
            mastered CSS Grid and Flexbox, which revolutionized my approach to
            responsive design.<br /><br />

            The debugging process taught me valuable lessons in problem-solving.
            I remember spending hours trying to figure out why my navigation bar
            wasn't aligning properly, only to discover I'd forgotten to close a
            &lt;div&gt; tag. Using browser developer tools became second nature,
            helping me inspect elements and test CSS changes in real-time. The
            biggest breakthrough came when I finally understood media queries -
            suddenly my site adapted beautifully to mobile devices.<br /><br />

            Throughout this project, I learned the importance of version
            control. Early on, I accidentally overwrote a day's work, which
            motivated me to properly implement Git with regular commits. This
            not only saved me from future disasters but also helped track my
            progress through the development timeline.

          <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
          <p>
            I chose a minimalist color scheme (#2c3e50 for headers, #3498db for
            accents, and #f8f9fa background) to create a professional appearance
            while ensuring accessibility. The high contrast between text and
            background colors meets WCAG guidelines, making the site usable for
            visually impaired visitors. I selected Arial as the primary font for
            its clean readability across devices.<br /><br />

            The project grid layout was inspired by popular portfolio sites like
            Behance, using CSS Grid's auto-fit functionality to create a
            responsive card system. I added subtle hover animations on project
            cards to enhance user interaction without being distracting. The
            navigation menu transforms into a vertical stack on mobile devices
            through media queries, ensuring usability on smaller screens.<br /><br />

            One design challenge was maintaining visual consistency across
            pages. I solved this by creating a style guide early in the process
            and using CSS variables for common values. The contact form's
            minimal styling keeps focus on functionality while aligning with the
            overall aesthetic.
